# vMenu: ox_lib Support
This fork is designed to integrate with [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest) you will require it for this to work.

This fork introduces some new exports that work with ox_lib for better UI features and to make the menu more convenient/easier to use for players.

Here's an example where we can move away from 3 separate input popups for rgb number values and to ox_lib's native inputDialog where the user can easily select a custom colour and visually see what they're choosing.

### List of Changes that this fork does:
- Colour Selector
  - Gives users a hex selector for custom colour setting within vehicle options (primary/secondary)
- Input Dialog Replace
  - Replaces the base game user input and replaces with ox_lib input dialog for easier use such as copy/pasting spawncodes etc.
- Keybinds for Thermal & Night Vision Modes
  - This is locked to users that have the permissions assigned to them.

If more are added, they will be listed here.

# vMenu
vMenu is a server-side menu for FiveM servers, including full\* permission support.


\*(Some features do not have permissions support as they are either harmless or it'd just be silly to deny them. However, they will be disabled if you deny access to the submenu that they are a part of (eg: unlimited stamina in Player Options will be disabled if you deny `vMenu.PlayerOptions.Menu`.))

## MenuAPI
Starting from vMenu v2.1.0, vMenu will be using [MenuAPI (MAPI)](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/MenuAPI), a custom menu API designed specifically for vMenu by me.

vMenu v2.0.0 and earlier was [using a modified version of NativeUI](https://github.com/TomGrobbe/NativeUI), originally by [Guad](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI), but converted to FiveM by the CitizenFX Collectives and myself (updated/refactored).
